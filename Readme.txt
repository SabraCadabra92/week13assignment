What was your favorite topic covered in this class?

I found Navigation to be the most interesting topic. If not executed correctly, the user experience will be poor leading to the apps potential failure. I believe it's fine to have a few annoyances throughout the application, but if the very foundation of the app is frustrating for users, chances are they will not use the app again.
